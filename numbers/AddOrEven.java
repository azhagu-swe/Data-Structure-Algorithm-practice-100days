/*
 * interview question and answers
 * 
 * Basic Questions
 * "How do you determine if a number is even or odd?"
 * (Expected Answer:
 * "Divide by 2. If the remainder is 0, it's even; otherwise, it's odd.")
 * 
 * "What operator do you use to check if a number is even?"
 * (Expected Answer: "The modulus (%) operator.")
 * 
 * Coding-Based Questions
 * "Can you write a simple program to check if a number is even or odd?"
 * (You would write a basic code snippet using if (num % 2 == 0).)
 * 
 * "How would you check for even or odd without using the modulus operator?"
 * (Possible Answer:
 * "Use bitwise operations like num & 1â€”if the last bit is 0, it's even; otherwise, it's odd."
 * )
 * 
 * Logical & Conceptual Questions
 * "What happens if the number is negative? Does the logic change?"
 * (Expected Answer:
 * "No, the logic remains the same. Negative numbers also follow the same even/odd rule."
 * )
 * 
 * "What is the time complexity of checking if a number is even or odd?"
 * (Expected Answer: "O(1) because it's a simple arithmetic operation.")
